    # Elasticseach is a Java program that requires lots of heap
    # memory to perform well and fast. Since the underlying library
    # used by Elasticseach is Lucene, and the library's data is
    # stored as immutable files, the Linux kernel will cache them
    # in the unused memory segments of the system. It is wise to
    # let Elasticsearch use 50% of RAM for the heap, and leave the
    # rest for the Lucene library to increase efficiency.
    # In my case, the virtual machine I'm using has 2 GiB of RAM
    # allocated, so I dedicate 1 GiB for Elasticdata. This is set
    # in the enviromental variable ES_HEAP_SIZE=1g.
